Use on Windows Subsystem for Linux
==================================

When using python-myfitnesspal on Windows via Windows Subsystem for Linux
you will encounter one extra complication when logging in
due to the mechanism python-myfitnesspal uses
for gathering authentication credentials.

You must log in to MyFitnessPal
via a browser installed on your guest (Linux) installation
instead of via one installed the conventional way.
