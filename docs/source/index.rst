Do you track your eating habits on `MyFitnessPal <https://www.myfitnesspal.com/>`_?  Have you ever wanted to analyze the information you're entering into MyFitnessPal programatically?  

Although MyFitnessPal `does have an API <https://www.myfitnesspal.com/api>`_, it is private-access only; this creates an unnecessary barrier between you and your data that can be overcome using this library.

Having problems? `Issues live on github <https://github.com/coddingtonbear/python-myfitnesspal/issues>`_.
